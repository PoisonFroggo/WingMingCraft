Welcome to WingMings (WingMing modpack for WingMingers)

This is a kitchen sink modpack for 1.16.5. Recommended RAM allocation is 6-8GB, and java 8 should be just fine. We use GitHub for versioning just to make sure that nothing conflicts. The general workflow is the following:

1. Make a branch from main
2. Add mods as needed, edit configs as needed
3. Test the additions, make sure there are no glaring issues
4. Merge into main

To package the modpack into a .zip file that can be imported into a modpack manager like PrismLauncher, do the following:
1. Make sure that you have the modpack loaded in Prism Launcher or Multi MC
2. Remove all settings such as java location, memory allocation, etc. as this is not information pertinent to the modpack
3. export things in accordance with the .packignore file (found in the main branch)
4. Now you have a .zip file.

The server side modpack is just the mods and configs folders.
