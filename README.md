Welcome to WingMings (WingMing modpack for WingMingers)

This is a kitchen sink modpack for 1.16.5. Recommended RAM allocation is 6-8GB, and java 8 should be just fine. We use GitHub for versioning just to make sure that nothing conflicts. The general workflow is the following:

1. Make a branch from main
2. Add mods as needed, edit configs as needed
3. Test the additions, make sure there are no glaring issues
4. Merge into main
5. abdann will package the modpack and upload to the Mega. PoisonFroggo will not package the modpack and upload to Mega.
6. Users can install the .zip by importing from zip using a modpack manager such as Prism Launcher. These .zips are packaged using Prism Launcher so they are guaranteed to work with it.
